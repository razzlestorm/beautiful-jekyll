title: Data Scientist-in-training
subtitle: Working with NLP to make my old job obsolete
---

I am a Data Scientist, with a focus on Natural Language Processing. I used to work as a Chinese translator (I still do, but I used to, too), translating all sorts of books, movies, TV shows, and video games. In fact, if you've watched CCTV4, you've probably seen my subtitles! I've translated over 15 million words (and counting), so if you'd like to learn more about my work, feel free to contact me!



## My Goal

I'm currently working on making a better version of myself (just like Frankenstein, what could go wrong?), that can do all my work for me while I lounge about in the sun. But NLP is complicated, so instead of lounging, I usually end up doing more research.
